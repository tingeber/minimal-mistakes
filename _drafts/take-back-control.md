excerpt: "On how algorithms make us angrier, and what we can do about it. Earlier this year, I published a paper on the role of algorithms in digital media. It explains how letting algorithms decide what is news (rather than journalists) changes the information we see. There is no way to avoid automated filtering: there is simply too much information in the pipes for humans to manage by themselves. The problem is, we have little or no control over what gets picked for us, or who decides what gets picked."
